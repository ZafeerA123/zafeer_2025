## Background

## Why did I take this class?

I took this class because I am very passionate about the field of computer science. Also, last year, I had taken the prerequisite to this class, CSSE 1-2. CSSE 1-2 really prepared me for this class, as it allowed me to complete most of the Tool Setups on the first day. Here is a link to my previous home page where all of my past projects are:

Due to my enrollment in CSSE, I am familiar with:

Github, Vscode, Javascript, HTML, using DevTools, Object Oriented Programming, Collobaration (20+ people), Altering Code, Creating simple games. 

## My Future Goals

After completing high school, I plan to go into some field of Engineering or Medicine. I'm passionate about technology and innovation, and I really hope to make a difference.
