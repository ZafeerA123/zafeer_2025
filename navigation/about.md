## Introduction

My name is Zafeer Ahmed. I am a junior at DNHS, and currently enrolled in:

<ul>
  <li class="fade-in">AP Physics</li>
  <li class="fade-in" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">AP Calculus AB</li>
  <li class="fade-in" style="animation-delay: 1s;">AP English</li>
  <li class="fade-in" style="animation-delay: 1.5s;">AP Computer Science Principles</li>
  <li class="fade-in" style="animation-delay: 1.5s;">Spanish 6</li>
</ul>

## Why did I take this class?

I took this class because I am very passionate about the field of computer science. Also, last year, I had taken the prerequisite to this class, CSSE 1-2. CSSE 1-2 really prepared me for this class, as it allowed me to complete most of the Tool Setups on the first day. Here is a link to my previous home page where all of my past projects are:

## My Future Goals

After completing high school, I plan to go into some field of Engineering or Medicine. I'm passionate about technology and innovation, and I really hope to make a difference.
