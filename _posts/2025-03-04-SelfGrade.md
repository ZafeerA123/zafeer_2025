## Honest Self Grade

Honest Self-Grade:
Points: 9.4/10

Reasoning:

4.4/5 points: I discused 5 things I did over 12 weeks in the live review presentation, including issues and burndown lists on my Kanban board. I accomplished all requirements given to me, but feel that there is a lot of improvements for my website features and website as a whole.

2/2 points: I blogged my Fullstack process that includes fulfilled CPT requirements and in my Final Blog and issue on the frontend repo, I discussed N@tM feedback and how it impacts future website plans.

1/1 point: I blogged my flashcard (Project Feature) and used language from the CPT requirements and FRQ

1/1 point: I completed the 2020 MCQ and blogged my errors, what I need to learn more about, and steps I will take to improve.

1/1 point: In my Final Blog, I discuss three other website presentations I saw and what I found interesting. I reflected on my future in Computer Science, future plans for my website, and individual strengths and weaknesses. I also did a practice live review with three other students from different periods and projects to prepare for Mondayâ€™s live review (Elliot Y, Noah H, and Johan M). I have also sent you this honest self-grade.
