# üöÄ **12-Week Development Progress**

This blog outlines my contributions over the past 12 weeks, covering my work on the flashcards feature, database integration and API work, deployment, backend UI, and overall project management.

---

## üõ† **1. Individual Feature of Flashcards**
This section covers the development of the flashcards feature.

  </div>
<br><br>

The first thing that I worked on during this project was the implementation of flashcards. One struggle I had while making flashcards was figuring out how to implement the Update and Delete function. 

Update and Delete needed to have a specefic flashcard id, 
```python
@flashcard_api.route('/flashcard/<int:flashcard_id>'
```

while Post and Get didn't.

Strength: 
- Problem Solving
- Perserverance

Weakness:
- Team Collaboration
- Communcation

## üõ† **2. Individual Feature of Decks**
  <div id="123456">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/deck.png" style="width: 190000px;">
  </div>
<br><br>

Initial thought:
Originally, I thought of scrapping the idea of decks all together. But then I realized that it would be better for the UI for students to have a better organized system.

Decks store multiple flashcards and are managed via the deck_api.py.
Flashcards belong to decks and are managed in flashcard_api.py.
The model folder defines the structure for decks and flashcards.

## üóÑ **3. Databasing and Data Management **

## üåç **4. Deployment**

Even though not my role, I did my best to understand and comprehend deployment, and being a Backend Admin Engineer I needed to do so.

## üé® **5. Backend UI**

My job of Backend Admin Engineer included changing the UI for our deployed backend page.

  <div id="123456">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/backendUI.png" style="width: 190000px;">
  </div>
<br><br>

Originally our backend UI was plain, and only included user_management. One weakness of mine is HTML, so this backend UI was not easy to implement flashcard management into.

## üìä ** Burndown & Issues**
One thing I became known for in our group was making sure everyone git pulled. This might not seem like a lot, but we once had to spend a whole week re organizing our repo due to git pulling issues.

| ## Strength and Weakness Reflection

| Perseverance in refining features like flashcard updating and deck organization                        | At times, the team was more separated than connected during the project                                                    |
                                                |


## Next Steps
Now that the flashcards and deck system are fully functional, I plan to refine user experience by improving error handling and visual feedback on the frontend. For example:

Displaying clearer error messages when users attempt to update or delete a non-existent flashcard.
Enhancing loading indicators to show progress when fetching flashcard data from the database.
Potentially implementing a review mode, where students can mark flashcards as ‚Äúmastered‚Äù or ‚Äúneed review.‚Äù
Additionally, I want to explore performance optimizations in database queries to ensure that our flashcard system runs smoothly even as we scale.


## Next in CompSci
After completing this project, I realized that backend development interests me the most, but I also want to gain a stronger grasp of full-stack development. 

I want to Work on a new project that incorporates AI, potentially integrating machine learning models for automated study recommendations.
Overall, this project helped solidify my passion for backend engineering, and I look forward to applying these skills in future projects
