🚀 **Optivize: AI-Enhanced Business Platform**  
🔧 Backend Dev | 👥 Team Lead | 🏆 N@tM Showcase (June 2025)  

---

### 🎯 Project Overview  

**Optivize** is a fully deployed AI platform designed to streamline small business operations. Built in a **HyFlex learning environment**, this project emphasized real-world deployment, API integration, and team-based agile practices.

🧠 **Type:** HyFlex | Real-World Tool  
🔗 **NFT Credential:** Chatbot + Sheets API Integration  
📜 **Microcredentials:** Backend Dev • OAuth API • DevOps • Database Modeling  
---

### 🛠️ Technical Highlights  

#### 🔌 Backend & API Integration  
I architected and implemented our core backend using **Flask** and **SQLAlchemy**:
- Modular API services for inventory, chatbot, and sales prediction  
- Clean integration of chatbot with inventory and calendar APIs  
- Persistent user data and logs through relational DB schema

#### 📥 Google Sheets Import (OAuth)  
I registered **Optivize** as a verified OAuth app and built a full Sheets integration flow:
- Token authentication, scope handling, and callback processing  
- Custom parser to auto-detect inventory values and add them to the DB  
- Connected the import directly to chatbot and frontend views  
- Designed RESTful APIs for adding, updating, deleting items  
- Inventory data is tied directly into chatbot and prediction features  
- Integrated with Google Sheets import to auto-update stock levels

#### ⚙️ DevOps & Deployment  
Deployment and version control were part of my core responsibility:
- GitHub PRs, merge conflict resolution, and detailed commit history  
- Deployed with **Ubuntu**, `makefile`, `nginx`, **Render**, and **GitHub Pages**  
- Local Docker setup using `docker-compose up -d` for backend tests

### 🤝 Teamwork & HyFlex Process  
As backend lead, I embraced a **Scrum-style workflow** and mentored teammates:
- Code reviews and backend planning  
- Maintained syncing between frontend/backend repos  
- Helped resolve multi-day merge issues during early repo refactoring

### 🧠 Reflection  

Optivize let me turn advanced backend work into **microcredentials**, and the chatbot + Sheets importer were **NFT-worthy** contributions in our **HyFlex learning** environment.  

This wasn't just a school project. It was a production-level system. We learned how to build like engineers.
