## Notes
- The digital divide is the gap between people who have access to technology and those who don‚Äôt.
- It affects important areas like education, jobs, healthcare, and civic participation.
- Rural and low-income communities often lack access to fast internet and modern devices.
- Bias in computing can come from how tools are built‚Äîoften without input from all communities.
- Solutions include better infrastructure, subsidized devices, inclusive design, and fair tech policies.

## Popcorn Hack 1

**Q:** Identify one area where you‚Äôve seen the digital divide in action. How does it affect people in different socioeconomic backgrounds?

**A:**  
I‚Äôve seen the digital divide in **education**. Some students have fast Wi-Fi and laptops at home, while others need to use school Wi-Fi or shared devices. This makes it harder for low-income students to keep up with homework, and research. It creates an unfair gap in learning and opportunity.

## Homework Hack

**Q:** Write 5 sentences on the digital divide in your community and how you can help bridge it.

**A:**  
In parts of my city, not everyone has access to high-speed internet. Some people use public libraries or fast food Wi-Fi to finish homework, while others take it for granted at home. I‚Äôve noticed that even school-provided devices don‚Äôt help much if families can‚Äôt afford reliable internet. To help bridge the gap, I can volunteer to create simple tech guides. I can also speak up about this issue to people at my school and support device donation drives.
