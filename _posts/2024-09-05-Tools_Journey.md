My tools journey starts off with my switiching from a chromebook to a windows computer. Intially, last year I had started with kasm on a chromebook, and had gotten used to the slow internet and the lenghty moments of kasm being down. But this year, I had upgraded to my own windows computer. 

The downloading journey had started with me going onto nighthawk pages and downloading all the specefic tools needed for windows. I also got to start using terminal, which I was not used to because Kasm had it's own built in terminal. This created the opportunity for me to expereince how to download tools firsthand rather than kasm's built in tools like vscode.
