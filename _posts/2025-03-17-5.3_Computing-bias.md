# Big Idea 5 - Computing Bias

## 📌 What is Computing Bias?
- **Bias**: Prejudice for or against a group unfairly.
- **Computing Bias**: When algorithms or computer systems favor or disadvantage groups unfairly.
- **Causes**: Biased data, flawed design, unintended programming outcomes.

---

## 🎥 Example: Netflix Recommendation Bias
### 🔍 How Bias Can Occur:
- **Majority Preference Bias**: Favors popular content, hides niche options.
- **Filtering Bias**: Limits recommendations based on narrow user history.

---

## 🧐 How Does Computing Bias Happen?
1. **Unrepresentative or Incomplete Data**: Lack of diversity = biased results.
2. **Flawed or Biased Data**: Historical prejudice in data leads to biased output.
3. **Data Collection & Labeling**: Human annotators may add bias unintentionally.

## 📊 Explicit Data vs. Implicit Data
- **Explicit Data**:
  - **Definition**: Directly provided by user/programmer.
  - **Example**: Name, age, preferences, user ratings.

- **Implicit Data**:
  - **Definition**: Inferred from behavior, not directly given.
  - **Example**: Viewing history, watch time.

---

### ⚖️ Implications:
- **Implicit Data**: May reinforce past preferences, limit content diversity.
- **Explicit Data**: More accurate but still prone to bias via input design.

## 🤔 Popcorn Hack #1
**Question**: What is an example of Explicit Data?
- **A)** Netflix recommends shows based on your viewing history.
- **B)** You provide your name, age, and preferences when creating a Netflix account.
- **C)** Netflix tracks the time you spend watching certain genres.
- **Answer**: **B)** You provide your name, age, and preferences when creating a Netflix account.

## 📝 Types of Bias

### 🤖 Algorithmic Bias
- **Definition**: Bias from flawed algorithms.
- **Example**: Amazon hiring algorithm favoring men due to biased past data.

### 📈 Data Bias
- **Definition**: Bias in the dataset itself.
- **Example**: Healthcare AI underestimating risk for underrepresented populations.

### 🧠 Cognitive Bias
- **Definition**: Human bias during data collection.
- **Example**: Researcher choosing data supporting their screen time belief (confirmation bias).

---

## 🤔 Popcorn Hack #2
**Question**: What is an example of Data Bias?
- **A)** A hiring algorithm favors male candidates because the training data contains a disproportionate number of male resumes.
- **B)** A system is trained on a dataset where certain groups, such as people with darker skin tones, are underrepresented.
- **C)** A researcher intentionally selects data that supports their own beliefs about the impact of screen time on grades.
- **Answer**: **B)** A system is trained on a dataset where certain groups, such as people with darker skin tones, are underrepresented.

## Intentional Bias vs. Unintentional Bias

### **Intentional Bias**:
- **Definition**: Bias deliberately introduced.
- **Example**: Algorithm prioritizing resumes with keywords
