## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Concerns

### Intellectual Property (IP)
- **Definition**: Creations of the mind protected by law.
- **Types**:
  - **Copyright**: Protects creative works (books, music, software).
  - **Patents**: Protect inventions.
  - **Trademarks**: Protect brand identifiers (logos, slogans).
  - **Trade Secrets**: Protect confidential business info.

### Digital Impact:
- Easier to copy/share content online.
- Harder to control ownership & usage.

### Enforcing IP:
- Use licensing agreements and Digital Rights Management (DRM).
- Monitor for unauthorized use.

## üìù Licensing a Repository

### What is a Software License?
- Legal terms for using, modifying, and sharing code.
- No license = **All Rights Reserved**.

### Why Licensing Matters:
- Protects your work.
- Enables collaboration with clear rules.
- Avoids legal trouble.

## üîì Open Source/Access

### Open Source Software (OSS)
- Public source code.
- Can be used, modified, distributed.

### Open Access Code
- Free online research.
- Minimal usage restrictions.

### Advantages:
- Encourages collaboration.
- Freely modifiable.

### Disadvantages:
- Can be misused for harm.

## üìú Open-Source Licenses Overview

| License      | Permissions                                      | Restrictions                                      | Common Uses                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **MIT**      | Use, modify, distribute with credit              | No warranty/liability                             | Web apps, libraries, frameworks      |
| **Apache 2.0**| Like MIT + patent protection                    | Must include license notice, no liability         | Large-scale projects, APIs           |
| **GPL**      | Use, modify, distribute, must stay open-source   | No private versions, share alike                  | Projects that must remain open       |
| **BSD 3-Clause**| Use, modify, share freely                     | Can't promote with original author's name         | Academic, closed-source projects     |
| **CC (CC0, CC-BY)** | Use as creator allows                    | Not for code, mostly docs/images                  | Docs, art, books                     |

## üé≠ SKIT EXAMPLES:
- **Non-Profit**: GPL ‚Äì forces code users to share their projects too.
- **Indie Developer**: MIT ‚Äì easy distribution with credit.
- **Big Tech**: Apache 2.0 ‚Äì patent protection + open-source.

## Popcorn Hacks 2
**Question**: You're building an open-source lyric guessing app. You want it to spread fast, but also don‚Äôt want big corporations to steal your work (without giving you credit!). Which license do you pick?
- **MIT**
- **GPL**
- **Apache 2.0**
- **Answer**: **GPL** ‚Äì forces others to keep their code open, preventing misuse.

## üö´ What is Breaking the Law?

| Action                                        | Reason                                             | License Violated                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Using unlicensed code                         | "All Rights Reserved" means no use allowed        | Any repo without license          |
| Modifying GPL code without sharing changes    | GPL requires shared modifications                 | GPL                               |
| Removing license notice                       | Required for many licenses                        | MIT, Apache, GPL                  |
| Selling open-source code as your own          | Must follow license terms                         | GPL, Apache, CC                   |
| Using NC-licensed code for profit             | NC = Non-commercial only                          | Creative Commons NC               |
| Using paid software without buying license    | License required                                  | Proprietary software              |

## ü§î Ethical Concerns

### Misusing Code:
- **Disrespect for IP**: Undermines creators‚Äô rights.
- **Violation of Trust**: Hurts open-source communities.
- **Unfair Advantage**: Hurts fair competitors.
- **Lack of Attribution**: Plagiarism.
- **Commercial Exploitation**: Profiting unethically.

## ‚ùå Plagiarism & Stealing Code
### What‚Äôs Wrong?
- Removing credit.
- Copying code from GitHub/Stack Overflow without credit.
- Selling open-source code without permission.

### What‚Äôs Right?
- Forking with author credit.
- Adding README for credit.
- Following license terms.
