# Popcorn Hack 1: Real-World Applications

### Question:
**Name two real-world applications where random number generation is essential and briefly explain why.**

### Answer:

1. **Online Gaming (e.g. Dice Rolls, Loot Drops)**
   - Random numbers are used to determine game outcomes such as dice rolls, card shuffling, enemy behavior, and loot drop chances. This randomness makes the game unpredictable and fair.

2. **Cybersecurity (e.g. Password Generation, Encryption)**
   - Secure systems rely on random numbers to generate unpredictable passwords, encryption keys, and tokens. This helps prevent hackers from guessing or reproducing access credentials.

# Popcorn Hack 2

```python
import random

def magic_8_ball():
    roll = random.randint(1, 100)
    if roll <= 50:
        return "Yes"
    elif roll <= 75:
        return "No"
    else:
        return "Ask again later"

# Test the magic_8_ball function
for _ in range(5):
    print(magic_8_ball())
#
```

# 🍿 Popcorn Hack 3: Traffic Light Simulation

### 🛠️ Modified Task:
- **Green** lasts **5** steps.
- **Yellow** lasts **2** steps.
- **Red** lasts **4** steps.
- Run the simulation for **20** time steps.

---

### 📝 Modified Python Code:

```python
states = ["Green", "Yellow", "Red"]
durations = {"Green": 5, "Yellow": 2, "Red": 4}
timeline = []

# Simulate 20 time steps
time = 0
state = "Green"
counter = 0

while time < 20:
    timeline.append((time, state))
    counter += 1
    if counter == durations[state]:
        counter = 0
        current_index = states.index(state)
        state = states[(current_index + 1) % len(states)]
    time += 1

for t, s in timeline:
    print(f"Time {t}: {s}")
```

Explanation: 
This is a simulation because it models the behavior of a real-world traffic light system over time without needing an actual traffic signal. It helps people understand and test timing patterns, which are important for road safety and efficient traffic flow. In the real world, such simulations are good for pedestrian and driver safety.


# Homework Hack 1

# 🎲 Homework Hack 1: Simple Dice Game (Randomness AND Simulation)

### 🎯 Game Rules:
1. Player rolls two dice.
2. **Win immediately** if the sum is **7** or **11**.
3. **Lose immediately** if the sum is **2**, **3**, or **12**.
4. Any other sum becomes the **“point”**.
5. Player keeps rolling:
   - **Win** if they roll the point again.
   - **Lose** if they roll a **7**.
