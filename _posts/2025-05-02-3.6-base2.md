## Binary (Base-2) Basics
- **Binary** uses two digits: 0 and 1 (OFF/ON states).
- **Bits**: Each digit in binary.
- **Why Binary?** Reliable for storing/transmitting data — all data (text, images, sound) are just long binary sequences.

## Comparing Number Systems

| Number | Decimal (Base 10) | Binary (Base 2) | Octal (Base 8) | Hexadecimal (Base 16) |
|:------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 10 | 2 | 2 |
| 4 | 4 | 100 | 4 | 4 |
| 8 | 8 | 1000 | 10 | 8 |
| 15 | 15 | 1111 | 17 | F |

- **Octal**: Early computing.
- **Hexadecimal**: Memory addresses, color codes.

---

## Binary Conversions
- **Decimal → Binary**: Divide by 2, record remainders bottom-up.
- **Binary → Decimal**: Multiply each bit by 2ⁿ based on position and sum.

**Example:**  
13 → 1101

---

## Binary Arithmetic
- **Addition Rules**:
  - 0 + 0 = 0
  - 0 + 1 = 1
  - 1 + 0 = 1
  - 1 + 1 = 10 (carry 1)
- **Subtraction Rules**:
  - 0 - 0 = 0
  - 1 - 0 = 1
  - 1 - 1 = 0
  - 0 - 1 = 1 (borrow 1)

---

## Two’s Complement (Negative Numbers)
1. Invert all bits.
2. Add 1.
- Example: 5 → `00000101` → flip → `11111010` → add 1 → `11111011` (−5)

---

## Bit Shifts
- **Left Shift**: Multiply by 2.
- **Right Shift**: Divide by 2.

---

## Real-World Applications
- **Storage**: 1 Byte = 8 Bits, 1 KB = 1024 Bytes, etc.
- **Networking**: IP addresses in binary (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

## Popcorn Hack 1: Identifying Binary

### Example 1
**Number:** `101010`  
- ✅ Only contains 0s and 1s → **This is a valid binary number**

### Example 2
**Number:** `12301`  
- ❌ Contains digits other than 0 and 1 → **This is NOT a valid binary number**

### Example 3
**Number:** `11001`  
- ✅ Only contains 0s and 1s → **This is a valid binary number**

# Homework Hack 1: Binary Converter

```python
# Decimal to Binary
def decimal_to_binary(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "0"
    binary = ""
    while n > 0:
        binary = str(n % 2) + binary
        n = n // 2
    return binary

# Binary to Decimal
def binary_to_decimal(b):
    return int(b, 2)

# Example Tests
print("Decimal 10 to Binary:", decimal_to_binary(10))  # Output: 1010
print("Binary 1010 to Decimal:", binary_to_decimal("1010"))  # Output: 10
```

# Homework Hack 2: Difficulty Level Checker

```python
import time

difficulty = input("Enter difficulty (easy, medium, hard): ").lower().strip()

while difficulty not in ["easy", "medium", "hard"]:
    print("Please enter a valid difficulty level.")
    difficulty = input("Enter difficulty (easy, medium, hard): ").lower().strip()
    time.sleep(0.5)

print("Difficulty set to:", difficulty)
```
