# üìö Teaching Graphs

## üìå Definition
Graphs are a fundamental data structure in computer science used to model relationships between objects.  
Each object is a **node (vertex)**, and the connection between them is an **edge (arc)**.

- In a **complete graph**, there is a single edge between every pair of distinct vertices.
- There are **no loops** and **no multiple edges** in such graphs.

---

## üìç Common Uses of Graphs
- Pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Google Maps, GPS)
- Web page ranking (e.g., Google‚Äôs PageRank algorithm)
- Network routing (e.g., data packet transfers)

## üß† Warm-Up Activity

**Scenario:**  
You‚Äôre an Amazon delivery driver. You have 10 packages to deliver to 10 houses in a neighborhood.

**Questions to consider:**
- What strategies would you use to decide where to go first?
- How do real-life delivery companies solve this problem?
- Would it be practical to try every possible route? Why or why not?

> This activity introduces students to graph-based optimization problems, like the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).**

## üó∫Ô∏è Graph Representations

### ‚úÖ Adjacency Matrix
- A matrix of size `n x n` (where `n` is the number of vertices).
- Stores 0s and 1s:
  - `1` if there‚Äôs an edge between two vertices
  - `0` otherwise

**Undirected Graph Example:**  
Each edge is bidirectional: if there‚Äôs a connection between vertex `i` and `j`, then both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` = 1.

**Directed Graph Example:**  
Connections are one-way: if there‚Äôs an edge from `i` to `j`, then only `matrix[i][j] = 1`.

### ‚úÖ Adjacency List
- Uses an **array of lists** to represent which vertices are connected.
- Each index in the array corresponds to a **vertex**.
- Each element in the list is a **neighboring vertex**.

## ‚úÖ Completed Hacks

### üß† Warm-Up Activity: Amazon Delivery Driver

**Prompt:**  
Imagine you are a delivery driver for Amazon. You have 10 packages to deliver to 10 different houses in a neighborhood. What‚Äôs the best way to plan your route so you don‚Äôt waste time and gas?

**Response:**

To plan the most efficient route, I would:
- Identify clusters of houses to minimize backtracking.
- Use a **graph** to represent houses (nodes) and roads (edges), with edge weights as **travel time or distance**.
- Apply a **pathfinding algorithm** like **Dijkstra‚Äôs** or **A\*** to find the shortest path.
- Use a **heuristic** like **Nearest Neighbor** as a greedy approximation for the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.

**Why not try every possible route?**  
There are `10! = 3,628,800` possible permutations, which is computationally inefficient.  
Real-world systems use smart **heuristics or optimization algorithms** to find near-optimal paths quickly.

## üçø Popcorn Hack: Graph Representation of Cities

**Prompt:**  
How can we represent cities and paths as graphs?

**Response:**

- **Nodes (Vertices):** Cities  
- **Edges:** Roads between the cities  
- **Weights on Edges:** Could represent **distances**, **tolls**, or **travel time**

**Example Graph:**

  <div id="popcornhackgraph">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/popcornhackgraphs.png" style="width: 19000px;">
  </div>

A ‚Üî B (10 mi)
A ‚Üî C (20 mi)
B ‚Üî D (15 mi)
C ‚Üî D (30 mi)
D ‚Üî E (10 mi)


**What can we do with this graph?**
- Evaluate different paths from **A to E**
- Use **shortest path algorithms** to find the optimal route
- Add or remove roads dynamically to simulate construction or closures

## üè† Homework Hack: College Board Example

### Q1:
**In which of the configurations is it possible to have redundant routing between devices Q and V?**  
**Answer:**  
**C) Both configuration I and configuration II**  
**Explanation:**  
Redundant routing exists when **multiple paths** connect Q and V, which appears in **both configurations**.

---

### Q2:
**In configuration I, what is the minimum number of connections that must be broken or removed before device T can no longer communicate with device U?**  
**Answer:**  
**B) Two**  
**Explanation:**  
There are at least **two distinct paths** between T and U. Removing both will isolate communication.
